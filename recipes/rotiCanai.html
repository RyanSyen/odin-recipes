                    <li>1 egg , room temperature</li>

                    <li>1 Â¼ cup water (310 ml)</li>

                <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
            </div>
            <h4>The Dough</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>In a standing mixer bowl, add in flour, salt, egg, melted butter, condensed milk and water. Mix to
                    incorporate and knead for 10 minutes. Leave to rest for 10 minutes and knead for another 5 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Divide the dough into 10 small balls. Coat each ball generously with unsalted butter and place them
                    in a container that has been generously buttered. Cover the container tightly with cling film and
                    keep in the fridge overnight.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Shaping</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The next day. Spread some unsalted butter on the working surface. Take one ball and lightly flatten
                    it. Press and push the dough with the heel of your palm to make it bigger. Stretch it as thin as
                    possible, until you can almost see through it. Now and then spread some soften unsalted butter on it
                    to help the stretching. Optional, lift up one edge of the dough and gently pull to stretch it even
                    more.</li>
                <li>Scrape and push the upper end of the dough to the middle. Do the same to the lower end, forming a
                    wrinkle thin log. Starting at one end of the log, roll it into a circle and tuck the other end
                    inside. Leave aside for 10 minutes before cooking. Meanwhile you can continue with the rest of the
                    balls.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Cooking</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Once ready to cook, take one rolled circle and flatten it into more or less 10-15 cm diameter. Heat
                    some unsalted butter on a pan using medium heat. Place the flatten dough on the pan. Cook for
                    several minutes and then flip. Continue cooking for some minutes more.</li>
                <li>This is important for a fluffy roti canai. Remove the cooked roti canai and place it on a working
                    surface. Immediately yet carefully grab it using both of your hands and squeeze it to the center. We
                    want to fluff it. You can see this part more clear in the video above.</li>
                <li>Keep the roti canai under a kitchen cloth to keep them warm. They're best eaten with dhal curry or
                    any type of curry with some sambal. Enjoy!</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Notes</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>If the balls are a bit difficult to spread (the next day), rest them at room temperature for 10-15
                    minutes.</li>
                <li>This roti canai is with less salt because it's not intended to be eaten alone. It's usually dipped
                    in varieties of curries. Add more salt as needed, depending on how you want to eat it.</li>
